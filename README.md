# Heap Sort Example

This is a heapsort example I wrote for my second Analysis of Algorithms homework, during my 3rd year in ITU CE.

The homework contained 10 days of employee performance data and asked us to sort the performances. A performance score was calculated from the given employee data and employees were sorted based on that performance score. I gave **day1.csv** as an example data.

In the second part of the homework, we were asked to sort the numbers in the **numbers.csv** file in 10 steps by selecting the largest 200000 numbers in each step. At each step, we were asked to plot: The height of the heap before each step and the execution time of each step. The sorted numbers are written to **output.csv** file.
